NXT Light Sensor Block for EV3-G
================================

![](https://github.com/a10036gt/EV3-NXT-Light-Block/raw/master/help/en-GB/NXTLight.png)

In LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3-G, We can use Color Sensor Block (or Sound
Sensor Block) to control NXT Light Sensor,but it seems like not so
well
 So we made this Block to add support for read NXT Light Sensor value,
it is normalization of raw value, so you need to configure min and max
of raw value first
Some data You can find in LabVIEW®.
 
This Block made By OFDL Taiwan. Any Question? Please contact us [OFDL

 Note：This Block should work with EV3 Firmware versions from v1.06
onwards (include Home, Education, Developer and LabVIEW® ver.).

 It is recommended that the EV3 Firmware is always updated to the latest
version released from LEGO®.
 NXT Light Sensor Block is not officially supported by the LEGO® Group.
