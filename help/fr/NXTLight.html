<p>
In LEGO&reg; MINDSTORMS&reg; EV3-G, We can use Color Sensor Block (or Sound Sensor Block) to control NXT Light Sensor,but it seems like not so well..<br>
So we made this Block to add support for read NXT Light Sensor value, it is normalization of raw value, so you need to configure min and max of raw value first.<br>
Some data You can find in LabVIEW&reg;.
<br><br>
This Block made By OFDL Taiwan. Any Question? Please contact us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cljhofdl">OFDL Facebook Page</a>
<br><br>
Note：This Block should work with EV3 Firmware versions from v1.06 onwards (include Home, Education, Developer and LabVIEW&reg; ver.). <br>
It is recommended that the EV3 Firmware is always updated to the latest version released from LEGO&reg;.
<br>
NXT Light Sensor Block is not officially supported by the LEGO&reg; Group.
